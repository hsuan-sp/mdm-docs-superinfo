## Term Definition

***Remote Management**is the specific screen presented by the Setup Assistant on a new Apple device during the**Automated Device Enrollment**process.

Signifies:

***Detection**: The device has "called home" to Apple and recognized that it belongs to an organization (e.g., specific school).
***Consent**: The user must click "Next" or "Enroll" to download the MDM Profile.
***Mandate**: If the device is in ADE, this screen is usually mandatory and cannot be skipped, ensuring no device enters the fleet Unmanaged.

## Analogy

Remote Management is the**"School’s Digital Stamp."**When you first open a brand new iPad box, this screen is like the device holding up a badge saying:**"I belong to Taipei European School."**It’s the official hand-off where the iPad accepts the school’s rules and begins its life as a managed learning tool.

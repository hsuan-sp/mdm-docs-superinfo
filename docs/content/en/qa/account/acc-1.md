## Q: The system prompted to agree to 'New Terms and Conditions' when logging into Apple School Manager (ASM). Is this important?

## Answer**Yes, this is extremely important and should be prioritized immediately!**When Apple updates its service terms, a "Terms and Conditions" window will pop up when you log into Apple School Manager (ASM).

### Impact Scope

If you do not agree to the new terms, the following serious consequences will occur:

***New Device Registration Blocked**: Newly purchased devices will fail the Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) process, because Apple's servers will reject registration requests from your organization.
***VPP Content Sync Paused**: Volume Purchase Program (VPP) content synchronization will pause, and you will be unable to assign new apps or book licenses to your devices.
***New Features Unavailable**: You will lose access to newer administrative features in ASM, such as**Apple Intelligence controls**and**device AppleCare+ coverage information**.
***Long-term Risks**: Currently enrolled devices will not be immediately affected, but prolonged delays may prevent you from pushing new configuration profiles or app updates.

### Who Can Accept the Terms?

Only users with the**"Administrator"**role in ASM have the authority to accept these terms. Users with "Content Manager" or "Site Manager" roles cannot accept on behalf of the organization.

### Operational Steps

1. Log in to [school.apple.com](https://school.apple.com) using your Administrator account.
2. After a few seconds, the terms window will automatically pop up (or click the banner at the top).
3. Read the terms carefully and check the "I have read and agree..." boxes.
4. Check all necessary items and click the**"Agree"**button to complete.

### Practical Advice

We recommend that every school has at least**two Administrator accounts**(e.g., the ICT Director and a designated systems administrator) to ensure that if the primary contact is unavailable or leaves the school, critical management tasks can continue without interruption.

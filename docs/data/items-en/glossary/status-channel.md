## Definition

The Status Channel is a fundamental mechanism of **Declarative Device Management (DDM)**. It allows a device to "proactively" report status changes back to the MDM server—such as a successful app installation, a drop in battery level, or a change in security posture—without the server having to "ask" (poll) the device. This enables real-time monitoring and a much higher level of management efficiency.

## Plain English

Think of this as "The Emergency Radio." In the old days, a boss had to call every employee every hour to ask, "Is the project done yet?" (this is called polling). With the Status Channel, the employee just radios the boss the moment they finish a task: "I'm done!" It’s faster, uses less energy, and keeps the boss informed in real-time without constant interruptions.

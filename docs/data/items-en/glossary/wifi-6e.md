## Definition

Wi-Fi 6E is an advanced wireless standard that expands upon Wi-Fi 6 by operating in the 6 GHz frequency band. On supported Apple devices (such as iPad Pro M2/M4 or Apple Silicon Macs) running iPadOS 26.2 or later, this enables features like **160MHz Channel Bandwidth**, which can effectively double previous wireless speeds. This is particularly beneficial in high-density school environments for rapid file distribution and content caching.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Adding a Double-Lane Express Highway" to the school's internet. Most Wi-Fi works on "crowded local streets." Wi-Fi 6E opens up a brand-new, wider highway where modern iPads can travel twice as fast without getting stuck in "internet traffic." It makes downloading large textbooks and projects feel almost instant.

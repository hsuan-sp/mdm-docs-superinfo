## Definition

A Directory Service is a centralized database system (such as Microsoft Active Directory or LDAP) used by organizations to store and manage user identities, computer assets, and access permissions. MDM can integrate with a Directory Service to allow employees or students to log in to their devices or Self Service apps using their existing institutional credentials.

## Plain English

This is the school's "Address Book and ID Registry." It contains a detailed record of every student—who they are, what grade they’re in, and what they’re allowed to do. Other systems (like the MDM) "ask" this book whenever someone tries to log in, ensuring that everyone's information is consistent across all school computers.

## Definition

DHCP is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses to devices on a network. When a device connects to Wi-Fi, the DHCP server "leases" an IP address to it temporarily. This eliminates the need for manual IP configuration and prevents address conflicts. Once the lease expires, the IP is returned to a pool and can be recycled for another device.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Parking Attendant" for the internet. When you drive your car into a parking garage (connect to the network), the attendant automatically points you to an empty spot (an IP address). You don't have to find a spot yourself, and you'll never try to park in a space that someone else is already using.

## Definition

QR Code Enrollment is a simplified onboarding method that allows users to enroll their Apple devices into MDM by scanning a specific QR code. The QR code contains the MDM server's enrollment URL and required certificates. Once scanned, the device automatically downloads the management profile and begins the registration process, eliminating the need for users to manually type long server addresses or configuration details.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Scan-to-Check-In." Instead of requiring a student or teacher to manually type a long, complicated web address to set up their iPad, they just open the Camera app and scan a QR code. All the setup information is automatically filled in, and the iPad starts its first day of school without any typing errors.

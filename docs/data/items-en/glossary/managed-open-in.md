## Definition

Managed Open In is a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) feature that allows MDM to control how documents are shared between applications. For example, it can prevent a sensitive school document opened in a "Managed App" (like school email) from being shared or opened in an "Unmanaged App" (like a personal social media app). This prevents institutional data from accidentally leaking onto personal devices or unauthorized platforms.

## Plain English

This is the "Data Boundary" rule. It's like saying, "You can use school documents on the school’s official desks (Managed Apps), but you are not allowed to take those documents over to the coffee shop across the street (Personal Apps)." It ensures that school secrets and student files stay inside the school's fenced digital garden.

## Definition

Apple Configurator is a physical management tool for macOS. It is used to restore device firmware (IPSW), provision devices in bulk, and manually add devices not purchased through an authorized reseller into Apple Business Manager (ABM). It serves as the "last resort" tool for recovery and initialization when a device cannot be reached over the network via MDM.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "IT Workbench." If an iPad is completely frozen or won't connect to the internet, you use a USB cable to plug it into a Mac running Apple Configurator. It allows IT to "reinstall the engine" or force the device to register with the school's management system even if it was originally purchased at a regular retail store.

## Definition

DNS is the "phonebook" of the internet. It translates human-readable web addresses (e.g., `apple.com`) into the numeric IP addresses (e.g., `17.172.224.47`) that computers use to talk to each other. MDM can be used to force devices to use specific DNS servers to enable content filtering or speed up access to school resources.

## Plain English

This is the internet's "Directory Assistance." You know the name of the store you want to visit (the URL), but you don't know the phone number (the IP Address). You "call" the DNS server, it gives you the number, and then your computer can make the call and load the website.

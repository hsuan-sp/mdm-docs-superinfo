## Definition

A Global HTTP Proxy setting forces all network traffic (HTTP/HTTPS) from a device to be routed through a specific proxy server. This is frequently used by schools to implement content filtering (e.g., blocking inappropriate websites) and to log internet usage for digital citizenship monitoring. However, administrators should be aware that some high-bandwidth apps may struggle to connect through a strictly-enforced proxy.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Mandatory Security Checkpoint" for all internet traffic. Every "car" (piece of data) trying to leave or enter the device must first drive through this checkpoint to be inspected. While this allows the school to filter out "contraband" (blocked websites), it can sometimes cause a "traffic jam" (slower internet speeds) because every single thing has to stop and be checked.

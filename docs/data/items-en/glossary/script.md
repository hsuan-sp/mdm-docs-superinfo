## Definition

A Script is a collection of commands (typically written in Bash or Python) that can be executed as a program. In macOS management, scripts give administrators powerful control beyond the standard options available in MDM. Scripts can be used for custom tasks, such as modifying hidden system settings, automatically repairing printer connections, or performing routine maintenance like clearing temporary files.

## Plain English

Think of a Script as a "Special Magic Spell" for your computer. When the standard buttons and settings (the "normal tools") aren't enough to fix a problem, IT writes a specific spell (the Script) and tells the computer to cast it. The computer then follows the spell's instructions to perform complicated tasks that it couldn't do before.

## Definition

Enhanced multitasking gestures introduced in iPadOS 26.2. Users can now directly drag app icons from the Dock or Spotlight search to quickly create Split View, Slide Over, or complex window layouts. This significantly streamlines the iPad workflow, reducing the number of steps required to manage multiple active windows.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Organizing your desk" with one hand. Instead of opening apps one by one, you can just grab an icon from the shelf (the Dock) and drop it right onto the screen to start working side-by-side. It makes using two or three apps at once feel as natural as moving papers around on a real desk.

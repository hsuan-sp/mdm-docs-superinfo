## Definition

A specialized management capability introduced in iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 using **Declarative Device Management (DDM)**. This allows organizations to restrict app downloads and updates to Wi-Fi networks only, completely disabling the use of cellular data for these tasks. This is a vital tool for managing data costs and ensuring that students do not exhaust their mobile data plans on large app downloads.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Wi-Fi Only Mode" for apps. It’s like a parent setting a rule that says, "You can only download new games or big updates when you are connected to the home Wi-Fi, not while you're out using your phone data." This prevents students from accidentally using up all their monthly data on a single large download while on the bus.

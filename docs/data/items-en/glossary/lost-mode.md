## Definition

Lost Mode is a remote security capability within MDM for supervised iOS and iPadOS devices. When a device is reported missing, IT can enable Lost Mode to immediately lock the device, display a custom "Return to..." message, and track its GPS location. While in Lost Mode, the device cannot be used, and its data remains encrypted and inaccessible. Once the device is recovered, IT can remotely disable the lock.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Remote Digital Handcuff." If a student leaves their iPad on a bus, IT can press a button to instantly lock it. The screen will say something like "This iPad belongs to TES—Please call 02-1234-5678." At the same time, the iPad will start reporting its location on a map so it can be found. It protects the student's data and makes the iPad useless to anyone who finds it.

## Definition

Command History is a record within the MDM console of every command sent to a specific device, along with its execution status (e.g., Succeeded, Failed, or Pending). Administrators use this log to track the device's operational history, such as verifying when a "Lock Device" command was issued or investigating the specific error code associated with a failed app installation.

## Plain English

This is the device's "Transaction Log." Just as a bank statement lists every withdrawal and deposit, Command History lists every instruction the school IT team has sent to that specific iPad. If something goes wrong, IT can check the history to see exactly which command got stuck and why.

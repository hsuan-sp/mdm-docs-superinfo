## Definition

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed network of servers designed to speed up the delivery of digital content. In the context of school management, Apple works with local network providers to cache iOS updates and app installers on local nodes. When a school updates hundreds of iPads at once, the traffic is pulled from the nearest CDN node rather than Apple’s main servers, drastically increasing download speeds and preventing bandwidth congestion.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Local Grocery Store" for the internet. Instead of every school having to go to the main warehouse (Apple’s headquarters in the US) to get their supplies (updates), Apple sends the supplies to local "Convenience Stores" (CDNs) nearby. When it's time to update, the school just picks up the files from the local store, which is much faster and doesn't clog up the main highways.

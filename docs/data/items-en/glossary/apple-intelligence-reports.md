## Definition

Apple Intelligence Reports (AI Management) are advanced auditing and restriction features within MDM. To maintain academic integrity, schools can use MDM to disable AI-generated summaries in Safari or Mail. This ensures students are reading and summarizing content based on their own comprehension rather than relying on automated on-device assistance.

## Plain English

This is a mechanism to prevent "AI Plagiarism." Just as a teacher might require a student to write their own book report rather than copying from an older sibling, MDM can turn off the "AI Summarize" button on the tablet. This ensures that students are actually reading the full text and learning to synthesize information themselves.

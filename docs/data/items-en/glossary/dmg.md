## Definition

DMG is an Apple Disk Image file format exclusive to macOS. When double-clicked, it "mounts" to the desktop as a virtual disk drive, typically containing an application. To install the app, the user usually just drags the app icon from the DMG window to the "Applications" folder. This is the most common method for distributing third-party software on macOS.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Virtual Software CD." Downloading a DMG is like downloading a digital CD. When you open it, a "CD drive" appears on your computer containing the software. Once you've copied the software onto your Mac, you just "eject" the digital CD and delete the file.

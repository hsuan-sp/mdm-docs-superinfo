## Definition

The Setup Assistant is the collection of guidance screens that appear when an Apple device is turned on for the very first time (starting with the "Hello" screen). It guides the user through initial settings like Language, Wi-Fi, Apple Account, and Location Services. By using **Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)**, IT can choose to "skip" most of these screens, allowing a device to go from the box to a ready-to-use state in seconds.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Beginner's Tutorial" for your new device. Just like a video game asks you to choose your character’s name and settings at the start, the Setup Assistant asks you how you want your iPad to work. However, the school can choose to "Skip the Tutorial" for you, so when you turn the iPad on, it goes straight to the home screen, all set up and ready for class.

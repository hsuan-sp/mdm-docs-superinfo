## Definition

Deprecated is a technical term indicating that a specific feature, tool, or API has been marked as "obsolete" by the manufacturer. While the feature may still function in the current version of the OS, it is no longer being developed and will likely be removed in a future update. IT administrators should view this as an early warning to migrate to newer replacement technologies.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Notice of Demolition." The building (the old feature) hasn't been torn down yet, but the government has officially marked it for removal. Residents (IT administrators) should start looking for a new home as soon as possible so they aren't caught off guard when the bulldozers (system updates) finally arrive.

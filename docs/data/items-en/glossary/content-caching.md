## Definition

Content Caching is a built-in macOS service that accelerates the download of Apple-distributed software and data. A Mac with Content Caching enabled locally stores (caches) software updates, apps, and iCloud data that have already been downloaded by one device on the network. When other devices in the same school network need the same content, they pull it directly from the local Mac rather than Apple's servers, saving bandwidth and significantly speeding up the update process.

## Plain English

Think of this as the school's "Shared Resource Library." Instead of every student having to personally travel to the main city library (Apple's servers) to get a book (an update), one person goes to get it and puts a photocopy on the school’s front desk. Now, every other student can just grab a copy from the desk, saving everyone time and energy.

## Definition

An IP Address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.

* **Static IP**: Manually assigned and permanent.
* **Dynamic IP (DHCP)**: Automatically assigned by a server and subject to change over time.

MDM servers rely on accurate IP addressing to route management commands to the correct hardware.

## Plain English

Think of this as your device's "Digital Street Address." Just like a mail carrier needs a physical address to deliver a letter to your house, the internet needs an IP address to send data to your iPad. Some addresses are owned forever (Static), while others are like a hotel room number—you use it while you're there, but it might be given to someone else after you "check out" (Dynamic).

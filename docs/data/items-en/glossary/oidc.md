## Definition

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It is the modern standard used by services like **Jamf Connect** and Single Sign-On (SSO) platforms for authentication. Unlike older protocols, OIDC is designed for the cloud, supports Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and uses secure "Tokens" instead of transmitting actual passwords, making it much more resilient against phishing attacks.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Global Digital Passport" for websites. Instead of having to create a new name and password for every single school website, OIDC allows you to use your one "Official ID" (like your Google or Microsoft school account). Once you show your ID once, you get a "Temporary Pass" (a Token) that lets you walk into all the school's other "Digital Rooms" without having to show your ID again and again.

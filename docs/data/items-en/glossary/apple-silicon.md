## Definition

Apple Silicon refers to the family of high-performance chips (M1, M2, M3, M4, etc.) designed by Apple for the Mac and iPad. These chips introduce advanced hardware-level security, such as the **Volume Owner** concept. This requires physical user authentication (such as a local admin password or Touch ID) to perform certain management tasks, like installing OS updates or changing security levels. This represents a significant shift from older Intel Macs where MDM could perform these tasks purely through high-level administrative permissions.

## Plain English

This is the "High-Performance Engine" inside modern Apple computers. While it's incredibly fast, it's also much more secure. Think of it like a car that requires both a key and a Fingerprint Scan to start the engine. While it makes the computer almost impossible for a thief to use, it also means the school’s IT team has to use slightly different methods to keep everything updated and secure.

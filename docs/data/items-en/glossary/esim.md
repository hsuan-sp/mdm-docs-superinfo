## Definition

An eSIM (embedded SIM) is a digital SIM card that is built directly into the device's hardware. For cellular-enabled iPads or iPhones, organizations can use MDM to push carrier plans directly to the device over the air. This eliminates the need to purchase, ship, and manually install physical SIM cards, greatly simplifying the deployment of mobile data for staff or field projects.

## Plain English

This is a "Virtual SIM Card." In the past, switching cellular providers meant using a paperclip to poke a tiny hole and swap a plastic card. With eSIM, you just "download" your phone number and data plan through the air. It’s faster, more secure, and you never have to worry about losing a tiny piece of plastic.

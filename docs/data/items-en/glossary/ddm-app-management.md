## Definition

DDM App Management is a modernized method for deploying applications using the Declarative Device Management (DDM) framework. Unlike traditional MDM, the device itself takes full responsibility for handling the download, monitoring installation progress, and managing retries. If a managed app is accidentally deleted by the user, the device detects the discrepancy and automatically re-installs it without needing a new command from the MDM server.

## Plain English

Think of this as an "Automatic Restocking" system for your apps. It’s like a smart vending machine that knows exactly what should be on each shelf. If someone takes an app off the "shelf" (deletes it), the machine immediately sees the empty spot and puts a new one back, ensuring the students always have the tools they need.

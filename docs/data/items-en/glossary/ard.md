## Definition

Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) is a powerful desktop management application for macOS. While MDM handles broad settings like Wi-Fi and security policies, ARD excels at "Real-Time" tasks on local networks. This includes monitoring multiple Mac screens simultaneously, remotely taking control of a keyboard/mouse to fix a problem, or rapidly pushing large files directly to a group of student laptops in a computer lab.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Immediate Control Console" for IT. If MDM is like posting school rules on a bulletin board, ARD is like a teacher standing in the room and helping you personally. IT can see your screen, move your mouse to show you how to fix a setting, or "broadcast" a file to every Mac in the room instantly.

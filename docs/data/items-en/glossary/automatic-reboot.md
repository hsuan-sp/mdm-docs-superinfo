## Definition

A specialized security feature introduced in OS version 26. MDM can configure a device to automatically reboot after a specific period of inactivity or extended lock time (e.g., being locked for more than 72 hours). This process clears sensitive decryption keys from the device’s volatile memory (RAM), enhancing the overall security of the hardware.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Timed Vault Lock." If the vault hasn't been opened for a long time, the security system automatically adds an extra layer of protection. If an iPad is lost and remains locked for several days, it reboots itself to "forget" any temporary passwords stored in its memory, making it much harder for a thief to access the data.

## MDM Context

Schools should use this feature to ensure that lost or stolen devices automatically enter a more secure state. It is important to inform parents and students that these reboots are an intentional security feature and not a hardware fault.

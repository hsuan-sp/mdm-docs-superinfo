## Definition

Rapid Security Response (RSR) is a specialized update mechanism from Apple designed to deliver important security fixes between larger software updates. Unlike a full OS upgrade, RSR files are small, install very quickly, and often do not require a full reboot (or only a standard restart). This allows IT administrators to deploy urgent patches against "Zero-Day" vulnerabilities without disrupting the classroom or enterprise workflow.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Digital Emergency Band-Aid." Instead of performing a major multi-hour surgery (a full system update), Apple can quickly apply a small "patch" to fix a specific security hole. It’s fast, simple, and makes sure your iPad is protected from a new threat the moment it's discovered, without making you wait through a long update screen.

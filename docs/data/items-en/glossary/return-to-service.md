## Definition

Return to Service is a modern automated deployment command for iOS and iPadOS. When an MDM sends a "Erase" command using this feature, it also embeds a Wi-Fi profile. After the device is wiped, it automatically reconnects to the Wi-Fi and re-enrolls into the MDM without any human interaction. This is essential for managing shared device fleets or specialized "Kiosk" stations.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Reincarnation with Memory." Usually, when you wipe an iPad, it "forgets" everything. With Return to Service, the iPad is wiped clean, but it has a "note in its pocket" (the Wi-Fi settings). It wakes up, sees the note, connects to the internet, and automatically reports back to the school's office for its new mission without anyone having to touch the screen.

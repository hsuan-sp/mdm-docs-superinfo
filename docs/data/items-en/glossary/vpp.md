## Definition

The Volume Purchase Program (VPP) is an Apple service that allows schools and businesses to purchase app and book licenses in bulk. These licenses are managed through **Apple School Manager (ASM)** and can be distributed wirelessly to student devices via MDM. Crucially, the school retains ownership of the license; if a student leaves, the license can be "revoked" and reassigned to a new student, saving the school from having to repurchase apps every year.

## Plain English

Think of this as the school's "Digital Bulk-Buying Account." Instead of every student having to use their own money to buy an app, the school buys 500 copies all at once. The school "lends" a copy to each student. When the school year is over, the school "takes the book back" electronically and puts it back in the digital library, ready for the next class to use.

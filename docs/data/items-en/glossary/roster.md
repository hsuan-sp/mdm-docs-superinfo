## Definition

In a digital education environment, a Roster is the official list of students and teachers assigned to specific classes. Within Apple School Manager (ASM), roster data can be imported automatically via SFTP or manual CSV uploads. This data is then used to populate the Apple **Classroom** and **Schoolwork** apps, ensuring that teachers see the correct list of students as soon as they start a lesson.

## Plain English

This is the "Digital Roll Call List." Instead of a teacher having to type in every student's name one by one, the school's central computer system automatically "tells" the teacher's iPad exactly who is supposed to be in their class. When the teacher opens their teaching app, the names are already there, ready for the lesson to begin.

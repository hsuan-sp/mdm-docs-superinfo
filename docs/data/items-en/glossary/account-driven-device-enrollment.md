## Definition

Account-Driven Device Enrollment is a modernized method for enrolling personal devices in a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) environment. Users simply sign in with their "Managed Apple Account" in the Settings app, and the system automatically guides them through the MDM enrollment process. This mode enforces a strict separation between work data and personal data (User Enrollment), ensuring that the organization can only manage business apps and data while keeping personal photos and messages private.

## Plain English

This is a "Log-in to Manage" mechanism. It's as simple as signing into your work email. Once you log in, your phone creates a separate "Work Workspace" for company apps and files. If you ever leave the company and log out, that entire workspace disappears instantly, leaving your personal data completely untouched.

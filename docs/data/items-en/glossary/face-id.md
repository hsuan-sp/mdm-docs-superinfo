## Definition

Face ID is Apple’s facial recognition technology, which uses a TrueDepth camera system to project infrared dots and create a 3D mathematical model of a user's face. It provides a higher level of security than traditional fingerprint or 2D photo recognition. MDM can require users to enable Face ID or Touch ID to access school-managed apps, serving as a vital second layer of defense for student data.

## Plain English

This is "3D Facial Scanning." It doesn't just take a photo; it scans the actual shape of your face using invisible light. Even if someone has a high-quality photo or a mask of you, they can’t trick the system. It’s a fast and very secure way to make sure only the correct student is using the device.

## Definition

An official tool introduced in iOS 26.3 that facilitates the seamless migration of user data from an iPhone to an Android device. It supports the transfer of core content, including contacts, photos, calendars, and messages. While primarily a consumer feature, MDM administrators should be aware of this tool as it provides a path for data to leave the managed iOS ecosystem if not restricted by institutional policy.

## Plain English

This is the "Migration Helper" for when someone switches their phone style. Just as Apple has a tool to help people move from Android to iPhone, this new tool helps people move their photos and contacts in the opposite direction. For schools, it's something to keep an eye on, to make sure school-owned files aren't being moved to a personal Android phone where the school can no longer protect them.

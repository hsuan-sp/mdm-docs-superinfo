## Definition

Compliance refers to whether a device currently meets the organization’s established security standards. Administrators define a set of conditions—such as requiring a passcode, running the latest OS version, or ensuring the device is not jailbroken. MDM continuously monitors the device's state; if it drifts out of compliance, the system can automatically trigger alerts or restrict access to school resources.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Security Health Check." Before entering a cleanroom, you must be checked for proper gear. Similarly, the system checks every device to see if it is "healthy" and following the rules. If a device has an old, unpatched system or no password, it’s "out of compliance" and might be blocked from the school Wi-Fi until it is fixed.

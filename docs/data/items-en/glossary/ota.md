## Definition

Over-the-Air (OTA) refers to the wireless delivery of software updates, configuration profiles, or system data. Instead of requiring a physical connection (like a USB cable) to a computer, devices receive instructions and data via Wi-Fi or cellular networks. This is the primary method MDM uses to manage a fleet of devices distributed across a campus or even when students are working from home.

## Plain English

This is "Wireless Magic." In the old days, if you wanted to update a phone or install a program, you had to plug it into a computer with a cable. Now, the "updates" just fly through the air and land on your device automatically. As long as you have Wi-Fi, the school's IT team can fix problems or give you new apps without ever having to touch your iPad.

## Definition

A Firmware Password is a low-level security lock for Intel-based Macs (replaced by "Recovery Lock" on Apple Silicon Macs). Once set, the password is required to boot the Mac from any disk other than the designated startup disk or to enter Recovery Mode. This prevents unauthorized users from bypassing the main login screen to steal data or wipe the computer.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Ignition Lock" for a computer. Standard passwords are like a house door—they keep people out of the rooms. A firmware password is like a lock on the engine itself. Without it, the computer won't even "start its engine" to let you reinstall the system or boot from a USB stick, making the Mac useless to a thief.

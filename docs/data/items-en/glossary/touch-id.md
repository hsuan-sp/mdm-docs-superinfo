## Definition

Touch ID is Apple's capacitive fingerprint identity sensor, seamlessly integrated into the Home button or Power button. It allows users to securely unlock their devices, authorize Apple Pay transactions, and sign in to various applications. MDM administrators can configure specific security policies that require Touch ID authentication to open sensitive school applications.

## Plain English

Think of this as your "Fingerprint Key." Instead of having to type in a 6-digit passcode every time you want to use your iPad, you just rest your finger on the sensor. The machine recognizes your unique fingerprint and lets you in instantly. It’s much faster and more secure than a standard password.

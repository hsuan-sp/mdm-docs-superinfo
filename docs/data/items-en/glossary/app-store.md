## Definition

The App Store is Apple’s official platform for downloading and updating applications. On supervised school devices, IT administrators often use MDM to hide the App Store icon. This prevents students from downloading unapproved games or distracting apps, instead directing them to the school’s private **Self Service** app to install pre-vetted educational tools.

## Plain English

This is Apple’s "Official Software Mall." To keep students focused and prevent the installation of unauthorized games, schools often choose to "Board up the mall doors" (hide the App Store icon). Students then go to the "School Supply Room" (the Self Service app) to get the specific tools their teachers have approved for the lesson.

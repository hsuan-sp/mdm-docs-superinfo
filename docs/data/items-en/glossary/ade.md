## Definition

Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) is the industry-standard method for deploying Apple devices (formerly known as DEP). When a school purchases devices through an authorized reseller, the serial numbers are automatically added to the school's Apple School Manager (ASM) account. As soon as the device is turned on and connected to Wi-Fi, it automatically downloads and installs the school's MDM profile. This process is mandatory and cannot be skipped by the user, enabling true "Zero-Touch" deployment.

## Plain English

This is the device's "Factory-Level Identity." It's as if every school iPad was born with the school's stamp on its forehead. No matter who holds the device or how many times it's reset, the moment it touches the internet, it "calls home" to the school’s management system and sets itself up according to the school's rules automatically.

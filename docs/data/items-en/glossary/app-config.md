## Definition

App Configuration (Managed App Config) allows MDM to inject settings (such as server URLs, usernames, or security toggles) directly into an app when it is deployed. This ensures that when a user opens the app for the first time, it is already customized for the organization, eliminating the need for manual setup and reducing user errors.

## Plain English

Think of this as an app that comes "Pre-filled." When IT sends you an email app, the server settings and your email address are already typed in for you. All you have to do is open the app and start working. You don't need to call IT to ask for complicated IP addresses or port numbers.

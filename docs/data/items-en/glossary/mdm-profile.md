## Definition

An MDM Profile (Mobile Device Management Profile) is the core configuration file installed on a device that establishes the "contract" between the device and the management server. Once this profile is installed, the device is officially "enrolled" and can receive apps, settings, and commands from the school. Conversely, if the MDM profile is removed, the device immediately lose its managed status, and all school-provided resources (such as Wi-Fi settings and managed apps) will be removed.

## Plain English

Think of this as the device's **"Employment Contract."** By installing this profile, the device agrees to follow the school's rules in exchange for getting access to school resources (like an ID card, office keys, and a desk). If you "tear up the contract" (remove the profile), you are no longer an employee, and you have to give back your ID card and keys—meaning all school apps and Wi-Fi access will disappear instantly.

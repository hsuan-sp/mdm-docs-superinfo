## Definition

Apple Pencil is an active stylus for iPad that supports pressure sensitivity and palm rejection. In specialized assessment or classroom scenarios, MDM can be used to disable the Bluetooth connection to the stylus or restrict certain gestures (such as "Double-Tap to switch tools") to prevent distraction or accidental input during strict exams.

## Plain English

This is the "High-Tech Pencil" for the iPad. In addition to writing, it has electronic features—like tapping the side of the pen to change to an eraser. During a high-stakes exam, the school can "lock" these digital features, turning it back into a standard pencil that can only write, preventing any unfair advantages or distractions.

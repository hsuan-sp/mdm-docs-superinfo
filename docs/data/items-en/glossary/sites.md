## Definition

Sites (or Jamf Pro Sites) is a multi-tenancy feature that allows a single Jamf Pro server to be divided into multiple virtual instances. Each "Site" can have its own independent administrators, device lists, and policies that are isolated from other sites. This is commonly used by large school districts or international school groups to manage multiple campuses from one central server while allowing each campus to handle its own daily operations.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Separate Offices in a Single Headquarters." The school district might have one big central computer (the server), but inside that computer, there are "private rooms" (Sites) for each individual school. The primary school staff can't see the secondary school’s iPads, and each school can set their own rules without interfering with the other.

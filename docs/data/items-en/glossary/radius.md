## Definition

RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is a networking protocol that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management for users that connect and use a network service. In a school environment, RADIUS is often paired with **802.1X** to verify user credentials or device certificates before allowing them to access the secure school Wi-Fi.

## Plain English

Think of RADIUS as the "Central Security Server" for a building's door locks. When you try to open the door (connect to Wi-Fi) with your keycard (your digital certificate), the lock doesn't decide if you can enter. Instead, it sends your data to the central server (RADIUS) to check if you are a real student. If the server says "Yes," the door unlocks and you're online.

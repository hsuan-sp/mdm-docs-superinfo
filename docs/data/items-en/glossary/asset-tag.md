## Definition

An Asset Tag is a unique identifier assigned by an organization for property management purposes, which is separate from the physical serial number of the Apple device. MDM can write this organization-specific number into the device’s system information and force it to display on the Lock Screen or Login window to facilitate physical inventory audits and hardware recovery.

## Plain English

This is a "Digital Property Sticker." Just like a school might put a physical barcode sticker on the back of a laptop or a chair, the MDM puts a digital version of that sticker right on the screen. If an iPad is lost, anyone who finds it can see the "Asset ID: A-101" tag on the Lock Screen and return it to the correct department without ever having to unlock the device.

## Definition

Background App Refresh allows apps to periodically check for updates and new content even while the device is in standby mode. For example, a Mail app might fetch new messages or a News app might pre-load headlines in the background. MDM can be used to enable or disable this feature globally or for specific apps to balance user convenience with battery longevity.

## Plain English

Think of this as the app's "Standby Concierge." While you aren't using the device, your apps are "tidying up" and "collecting mail" in the background so everything is ready the moment you unlock the iPad. If the concierge is working too hard and draining the battery, IT can tell them to rest (disable the feature).

## Definition

Rosetta 2 is a translation layer that allows Apple Silicon Macs to run apps built for Intel-based Macs. It automatically translates "Intel (x86_64) language" into "Apple Silicon (ARM64) language" in real-time. While it is incredibly efficient, it may require a one-time installation the first time an Intel app is opened. Large organizations can pre-deploy Rosetta 2 via MDM to ensure a smooth transition for users with older software.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Live Language Translator." The new M-series Macs speak one language (ARM), while older software speaks another (Intel). Rosetta 2 sits in the middle and translates everything instantly so your favorite older apps can still work on your brand-new Mac. It's like having a dedicated translator follows you around so you don't have to learn a new language.

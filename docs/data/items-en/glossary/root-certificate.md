## Definition

A Root Certificate is the foundation of the "Chain of Trust" in digital security. Every trusted certificate eventually traces back to a system-trusted **Root Certificate Authority (CA)**. For a school to use secure internal websites or Wi-Fi authentication, the MDM must first deploy the school's Root Certificate to student and staff devices. Once installed, the device will trust all other certificates signed by that Root CA.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Trusted Founder" of a family. Trust in digital security works like a family tree. If your device trusts the "Founder" (the Root Certificate), it will automatically trust all the Founder's "children and grandchildren" (the other certificates). If your device doesn't know the Founder, it will block the whole family from entering, which means you won't be able to connect to the school Wi-Fi.

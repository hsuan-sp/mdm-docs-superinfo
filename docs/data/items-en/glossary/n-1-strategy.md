## Definition

In the context of software support, an N-1 strategy refers to a policy of supporting the current latest major version (N) and the immediately preceding major version (N-1). For example, if iOS 18 is the current version (N), an N-1 policy would ensure full support for iOS 18 and iOS 17. Devices running older versions (N-2 or older) may lose compatibility with new management features or security patches.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Manufacturer's Warranty" for software. Just as a car company might keep spare parts for the newest model and the previous one, software companies focus on the current version and the one just before it. If your iPad is running a system that is 3 or 4 years old, it might eventually become impossible to fix or update with new school apps.

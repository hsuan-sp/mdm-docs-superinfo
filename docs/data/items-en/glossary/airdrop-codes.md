## Definition

Introduced in iOS 26.2, AirDrop Codes add an extra layer of privacy for file sharing. Users can generate a one-time code (valid for up to 30 days) to share with someone who is not in their contacts. The recipient must enter this code to verify the transfer. This ensures that files are only sent to the intended recipient and prevents unsolicited AirDrop requests.

## Plain English

In the past, AirDrop was like an "Open Mailbox"—anyone nearby could try to drop something in. With AirDrop Codes, it's like adding a "Combination Lock" to your mailbox. Only the people you give the code to can send you files, making it much more private and secure.

## MDM Context

Schools should evaluate how this affects their AirDrop policies. While it increases privacy, IT admins must ensure it doesn't bypass institutional restrictions. If MDM has disabled AirDrop entirely, the code functionality will also be unavailable.

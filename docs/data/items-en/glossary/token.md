## Definition

A Token is a digital credential used in authentication. Once a user has successfully signed in with their username and password, the server issues a "Token." For all subsequent requests during that session, the user's device simply presents the Token to gain access, eliminating the need to re-enter sensitive login credentials. Tokens typically have an expiration time for security purposes and must be renewed periodically.

## Plain English

Think of a Token as an "All-Day Pass" at an amusement park. You go to the front gate and show your official ID and pay for a ticket (this is entering your username and password). Instead of having to show your ID at every single ride, the park gives you a wristband (the Token). As long as you are wearing the wristband, you can walk onto any ride instantly without needing to prove who you are again.

## Definition

Automatic App Updates is a background mechanism in iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. When enabled, the device automatically downloads and installs the latest versions of apps when connected to Wi-Fi and in an idle state. MDM can be used to force-enable or disable this feature to ensure that all devices in the fleet maintain a consistent and unified app version.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Automatic Maintenance" for your apps. Just as a car dealership might automatically change your oil when you bring the car in, the system handles the updates behind the scenes so the apps are always ready to use. This ensures that students are not exposed to security vulnerabilities or missing features caused by running outdated software.

## Definition

A Secure Token is a specialized digital credential on macOS that grants a user the authority to manage **FileVault** encryption. In modern versions of macOS, only a user account with a Secure Token can unlock an encrypted startup disk or authorize changes to security settings. Typically, the first user account created on a new Mac is automatically granted a Secure Token.

## Plain English

Think of this as an "Authorization Stamp" for the computer’s safe. Even if you have the key (your login password), you can't open the "Main Vault" (the hard drive) unless your name has been officially stamped (granted a Secure Token) by the system. It’s an extra layer of protection to make sure only authorized "Managers" can touch the computer's most sensitive security locks.

## Definition

A Universal Binary is a single application file that contains executable code optimized for both Intel-based Macs and Apple Silicon (M-series) Macs. This allows developers to distribute one single app that runs natively and with peak performance on any modern Mac hardware without requiring the **Rosetta 2** translation layer.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Bilingual App." Instead of having to download one version for English-speaking Macs (Intel) and another for French-speaking Macs (Apple Silicon), the app contains both languages in one package. The computer automatically reads the version it understands best, making the app faster and more reliable on any computer you use.

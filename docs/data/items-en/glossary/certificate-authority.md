## Definition

A Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted third-party entity that issues and manages digital certificates. To establish a chain of trust, a device must first install and trust the CA’s "Root Certificate." Once trusted, the device will automatically accept all other "leaf" certificates (for Wi-Fi, VPN, or email) issued by that specific authority.

## Plain English

This is the "ID Issuing Office" of the internet. Think of it like a government passport office. Because we trust the office (the CA), we trust any passport (certificate) they stamp and issue. In a school, the IT department often runs its own private "ID Office" to give the school's iPads permission to use the campus Wi-Fi.

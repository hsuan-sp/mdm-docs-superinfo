## Definition

Apple Classroom is a dedicated app for teachers that providing powerful tools for classroom management. It uses Bluetooth and local Wi-Fi to monitor student screens, lock devices into specific apps, and share documents or web links instantly. Because it operates locally, it is highly responsive and does not rely on the MDM server for its real-time interactions, making it perfect for the day-to-day classroom environment.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Classroom Remote Control" for teachers. On their iPad, a teacher can see exactly what every student is doing. If a student gets distracted, the teacher can instantly lock their screen or switch them to the correct textbook app, ensuring the whole class stays on task during the lesson.

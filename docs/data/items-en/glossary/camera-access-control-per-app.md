## Definition

A granular MDM key introduced in OS version 26 (`allowedCameraRestrictionBundleIDs`). It allows administrators to grant or deny camera access to specific applications rather than using a global "On/Off" toggle for the entire hardware camera. This provides more flexible management of hardware resources while maintaining strict privacy standards.

## Plain English

In the past, camera access was like a "Main Door Key"—it was either all open or all locked. Now, it's like a "Hotel Keycard System." IT can let the classroom app use the camera for a project, while simultaneously blocking social media apps from using it, preventing distractions and protecting student privacy.

## Definition

A Payload is the smallest individual unit of a **Configuration Profile**. A single profile can contain multiple payloads; for example, a "Campus Wi-Fi" profile might include one payload for Wi-Fi settings and another for the required security certificates. Think of payloads as the individual "bricks" used to build a complete management policy.

## Plain English

This is a "Single Instruction" inside a rulebook. If a **Profile** is a complete "Student Handbook," a Payload is just one specific rule inside it—like "Rule 1: Use the school Wi-Fi" or "Rule 2: Don't use the camera." IT combines these individual instructions into one package to tell the iPad exactly how to behave.

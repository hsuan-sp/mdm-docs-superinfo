## Definition

Configuration Profile Removal refers to the MDM command used to remotely uninstall a specific set of settings from a device. When a profile is removed, any certificates, Wi-Fi credentials, VPN configurations, or restrictions associated with that profile are instantly deleted. This feature is essential for offboarding students or clearing organizational data from a device before it is redeployed.

## Plain English

This is the "Take It Back" button for IT. When a student graduates or an employee leaves, IT can click one button to remotely "reclaim" all the school’s digital property—like the school Wi-Fi password and specific school settings—leaving the device clean and ready for its next owner.

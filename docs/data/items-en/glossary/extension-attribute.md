## Definition

An Extension Attribute is an advanced feature in Jamf Pro that allows administrators to collect custom information that is not part of the standard MDM inventory protocol. By using scripts (such as Bash or Python), an administrator can report on specific data points, such as whether a Mac has a specific internal file, the number of battery cycles, or if a non-approved application is currently installed.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Custom Survey" for your computers. A standard inventory check only asks basic questions like "What's your serial number?" An Extension Attribute lets IT ask more specific questions, like "Did you restart your computer this week?" or "Is your hard drive almost full?". It helps IT find small problems before they become big ones.

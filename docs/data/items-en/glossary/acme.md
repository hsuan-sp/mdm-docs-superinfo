## Definition

Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) is a standard protocol for automating the management of digital certificates. It allows devices to automatically request, verify, and renew certificates from a Certificate Authority (CA) without manual intervention. In MDM, ACME is increasingly replacing the older SCEP protocol to ensure that device identity certificates remain valid and secure indefinitely.

## Plain English

ACME is an "Auto-Renewal Status" for your security certificates. Think of it like a digital ID that expires every few months. Instead of you having to fill out a form to renew it, the system automatically handles the paperwork and issues you a new ID in the background. You never lose access to the network because a certificate "expired" while you weren't looking.

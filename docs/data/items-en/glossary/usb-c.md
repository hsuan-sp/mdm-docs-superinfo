## Definition

USB-C (formally USB Type-C) is the industry-standard connector for all modern Apple hardware, including the latest iPhone, iPad, and Mac models. It is a high-performance, reversible port that supports power delivery (charging), data transfer at high speeds, and video output (DisplayPort). For school IT departments, USB-C simplifies charging setups but also requires MDM monitoring of "USB Restrictions" to prevent unauthorized data removal via portable drives.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Universal Connection Hole." In the old days, you had different cables for charging, connecting to a screen, and moving files. Now, one single "USB-C" port does it all. It’s faster, the cable works even if you flip it upside down, and it makes it much easier to keep your iPad charged and ready for the school day.

## Definition

Declarative Device Management (DDM) is Apple’s next-generation management architecture. Unlike traditional MDM, which relies on a server constantly "polling" a device with commands, DDM allows the device to hold a set of "Declarations" (rules) and manage itself autonomously. The device monitors its own state and reports back via the "Status Channel" only when a change occurs. This increases device autonomy, significantly reduces server load, and improves responsiveness.

## Plain English

This is the shift from "Following Orders" to "Autonomous Management." Traditional MDM is like a remote-control car where you have to press a button for every turn. DDM is like a self-driving car—you just give it the rules of the road (the declarations), and it handles the driving itself, only letting you know when it has reached a milestone or encountered an issue.

## Definition

A Bundle ID (Bundle Identifier) is a unique string that identifies an application within Apple’s operating systems (e.g., `com.google.chrome`). In MDM, administrators must use this precise ID—rather than the app's display name—to target specific apps for deployment, allow-listing, or configuring VPN associations.

## Plain English

This is the app's "Social Security Number." While there might be many apps named "Calculator," the Bundle ID is guaranteed to be unique. The IT system uses this number to make sure it is managing or installing the exact right app and doesn't get confused by apps with similar names.

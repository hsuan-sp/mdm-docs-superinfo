## Definition

Handoff is a core Continuity feature that allows a user to start a task on one Apple device and seamlessly continue it on another device nearby. For instance, if a teacher begins drafting an email on their iPhone while walking to class, they can instantly see an icon on their Mac’s Dock and click it to finish the email on the larger screen. This requires both devices to be signed into the same Apple ID with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi enabled.

## Plain English

This is a "Relay Race" for your work. Your iPhone runs the first lap (starts an email), and as soon as it reaches the "handoff zone" near your Mac, the Mac can take the baton and finish the race. You don't need to save a file or email it to yourself; the work just "jumps" from one screen to the other instantly.

## Definition

iBeacon is Apple’s implementation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) proximity sensing. Schools can place small iBeacon transmitters in specific locations, such as classrooms or the library. When a student’s iPad detects the beacon's signal, the MDM can automatically trigger specific actions, such as automatically muting the device in the library or opening a specific textbook app as soon as the student enters the classroom.

## Plain English

Think of these as "Invisible Sense-Posts" around the school. When an iPad walks past a post in the library, it doesn't need to be scanned; the system just "senses" the location and can automatically tell the iPad, "You're in the library now—please turn your volume down to zero." It helps make the technology respond intelligently to where the student is.

## Definition

DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode is the lowest-level recovery state for an iOS device, sitting below the standard Recovery Mode. When a device's OS is severely corrupted, won't boot, or is stuck on a startup loop, DFU mode is required to bypass the bootloader and force-reinstall the firmware. In this mode, the screen remains entirely black, and the device must be connected to a computer running Apple Configurator or Finder.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Digital Emergency Resuscitation." When a patient (the iPad) has no pulse and medicine (a restart) isn't working, they are sent to the ICU for heart surgery (DFU). It is a deep-level reset used to bring a "dead" device back to life when everything else has failed.

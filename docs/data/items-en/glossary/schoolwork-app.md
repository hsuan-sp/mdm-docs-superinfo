## Definition

Schoolwork is a powerful Apple app designed to help K-12 teachers and students stay organized and collaborate effectively. Teachers can use it to share "Handouts" (assignments), assign specific activities within educational apps, and track student progress in real-time. It integrates deeply with Apple Classroom and provides insights into how much time students spend on specific learning tasks.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Digital Homework and Communication Binder." It’s where teachers post assignments, share links to textbooks, and set due dates. Students can submit their work directly in the app, and teachers can see who has finished their work and how everyone is doing, all in one organized place.

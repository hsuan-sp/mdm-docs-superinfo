## Definition

A digital Certificate is an electronic document used to verify a device's identity and enable encrypted communication. In an MDM environment, certificates are used to prove who the device is (authentication), establish secure connections (TLS), and sign apps. If a certificate expires, the device may lose its ability to connect to Wi-Fi or communicate with the management server.

## Plain English

This is the "Digital Identity Card" for your device. Just as you need a physical ID to open a bank account, your iPad uses this certificate to prove to the school’s network that it is an official school device. As long as the ID is valid, the network trusts the device and allows it to connect securely.

## Definition

A Web Clip is a custom shortcut icon that IT administrators can place on a student’s device home screen via MDM. When tapped, it opens a specific URL directly in a full-screen mode (similar to a standalone app). This is commonly used in schools to provide one-tap access to school portals, learning platforms, or internal resources without requiring students to manually type long web addresses.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Bookmark on your Home Screen." Instead of having to open a browser and type in a long address for the school's learning website, IT places a special icon on your iPad that looks just like a regular app. You tap it, and it takes you straight to the correct website instantly. It’s a great time-saver for students and teachers.

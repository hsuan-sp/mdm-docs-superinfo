## Definition

Accessibility Features are a set of built-in tools in iOS, iPadOS, and macOS designed to help people with disabilities used their devices more effectively. These include VoiceOver (screen reading), Magnifier, Voice Control, and Switch Control. These tools ensure that individuals with vision, hearing, or motor impairments can interact with technology seamlessly. MDM can be used to pre-configure or lock specific accessibility settings for students with special needs.

## Plain English

Think of these as the "Universal Accessibility Ramps" of the digital world. Just as public buildings must have ramps and braille signs, Apple builds these tools directly into every device so that everyone, regardless of their physical needs, can learn and explore. Schools can turn these on automatically for students who need them, saving time for both the student and the teacher.

## Definition

An Admin Account is a user level in macOS with the highest privileges, capable of installing software, modifying system settings, and managing other users. In managed environments, IT departments typically maintain a hidden Admin account for maintenance purposes while downgrading regular employee or student accounts to "Standard User" status to prevent unauthorized system changes and improve security.

## Plain English

This is the "Grand Commander" of the computer. Whoever has this account can change anything, delete anything, or install any software. For safety, only IT staff usually have this level of access. Everyone else is given a "Standard Account," meaning they can use the computer to do their work, but they can't mess with the "engine" under the hood.

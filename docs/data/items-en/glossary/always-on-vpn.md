## Definition

Always-on VPN is a mandatory network security policy for managed devices. When a device detects a network connection, it automatically establishes an encrypted VPN tunnel to the organizational network in the background. If the tunnel fails to connect, the device can be configured to block all network traffic (Lockdown mode), ensuring that sensitive data is never transmitted over unencrypted public networks.

## Plain English

This is a "Mandatory Security Tunnel." Whether a student is at a cafe or an airport, the system forces all internet usage to go through the school's private, encrypted lane first. If the tunnel isn't available, the internet simply won't work. This ensures that no matter where the device goes, the data stays safe from hackers on public Wi-Fi.

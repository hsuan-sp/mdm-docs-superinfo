## Definition

"Install Later" is an MDM deployment strategy for system updates. When this command is used, the device downloads the update in the background while the student is working but defers the actual installation. The installation is typically scheduled for a period of inactivity (such as late at night) or when the user manually triggers it, ensuring that learning is not interrupted by a sudden forced restart.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Scheduling a Home Renovation." IT "delivers the building materials" (downloads the update) while the student is using the iPad, but the "construction" (the installation) doesn't start until the student is finished with their work and has gone to sleep. This way, the iPad is updated and ready the next morning without ever interrupting a lesson.

## Definition

A Custom B2B App is a specialized application developed specifically for an organization and distributed privately through the Volume Purchase Program (VPP). These apps are not available on the public App Store; they are only visible to the specific organization in Apple Business Manager (ABM), allowing IT to deploy internal-only tools or customized learning apps to their users securely.

## Plain English

This is a "Private Software" tool just for your organization. Think of it like a "Secret Menu" at a restaurant—regular customers can't see it or order it. Only authorized students or employees can see and install these apps through the school's private management system.

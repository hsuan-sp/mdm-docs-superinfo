## Definition

A Captive Portal is a web page that a user is prompted to view and interact with (e.g., to enter credentials or accept terms of service) before being granted access to a public Wi-Fi network. These are commonly found in hotels, airports, and coffee shops. Managed devices may struggle to complete MDM enrollment or background tasks when blocked by a Captive Portal until a user manually authenticates.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Questionnaire at the Door." Before you can enter the coffee shop's Wi-Fi, you have to answer a few questions or click "Agree." For managed school iPads, these portals can be a hurdle because the device can't talk to the school server until someone manually fills out the questionnaire on the screen.

## Definition

The Lightning Connector is Apple's proprietary physical charging and data transfer port used on iPhone 5 through iPhone 14, as well as older iPad models. While newer Apple hardware has transitioned to **USB-C**, many school device fleets still rely on Lightning for charging and connecting accessories. It supports USB 2.0 data speeds and is reversible, meaning there is no "correct" side to plug in.

## Plain English

This is the "Old Style" Apple charging port. Unlike the new USB-C ports that you see on the latest iPads and other phones, the Lightning cable only works with older Apple devices. While it's getting phased out, school "iPad carts" often still have a lot of these cables to keep older student tablets charged and ready for class.

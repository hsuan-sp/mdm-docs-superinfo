## Definition

Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) refers to the practice of employees or students using their personal devices to access organizational and educational resources. Apple’s "User Enrollment" mode allows organizations to create a separate, encrypted "Work Container" on a personal device to manage school data. Crucially, the organization has no access to the user's personal photos, messages, or apps, achieving a balance between institutional security and personal privacy.

## Plain English

This is a "Church and State" style of management. Imagine you have your own house (personal phone) and you set aside one specialized "Desk" (Work Container) for school work. The school can organize or collect papers from that desk at any time, but they have no right (and no way) to open your personal drawers or closet.

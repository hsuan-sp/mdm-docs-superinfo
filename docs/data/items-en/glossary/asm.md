## Definition

Apple School Manager (ASM) is the central web portal for education administrators to manage people, devices, and content. It acts as the "Education Version" of Apple Business Manager. ASM allows schools to link their **Student Information System (SIS)** to automatically create classes and **Managed Apple Accounts**. It is the essential foundation for zero-touch deployment and providing a secure, high-quality digital learning environment.

## Plain English

ASM is the school's "Digital Registrar's Office." It's the headquarters where the school registers every iPad, buys every educational app, and creates IDs for every student and teacher. It makes sure that when a teacher walks into a room, their iPad already "knows" exactly which students are in their class and which books they need.

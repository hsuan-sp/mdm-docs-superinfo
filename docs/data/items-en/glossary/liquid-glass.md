## Definition

Liquid Glass is the visual design language introduced by Apple in 2025 (OS version 26), inspired by visionOS. It features increased transparency, dynamic light reflections, and a fluid sense of depth. iPadOS 26 and macOS Tahoe use this design for the Lock Screen, app icons, and folders, creating a premium "glass-like" aesthetic that reacts to environmental lighting.

## Plain English

Imagine your iPad screen as a sheet of "Living Glass." When you move the device or change the lighting around you, the icons and background subtly reflect those changes, making the interface feel lighter and more breatheable.

## MDM Context

Users can adjust the opacity of the Liquid Glass effect in the Lock Screen settings (iOS 26.2+). Administrators should mention this in onboarding guides so students don't mistake the intentional transparency or background blur for a screen hardware failure.

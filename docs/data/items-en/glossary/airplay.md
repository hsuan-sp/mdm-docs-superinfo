## Definition

AirPlay is Apple’s wireless streaming protocol that allows users to mirror their device screen or stream audio/video to an Apple TV or AirPlay-enabled display. In classrooms, MDM can pre-configure AirPlay permissions—such as specifying which Apple TV a specific iPad is allowed to use or pre-filling security passwords—to ensure that only authorized students or teachers can present on the big screen.

## Plain English

This is the "Wireless Projector" feature. With one tap, a teacher can put their iPad screen up on the big classroom TV. To keep things orderly, IT can pre-program the passwords so teachers can just walk in and start teaching without having to hunt for a cable or ask for a complicated Wi-Fi password.

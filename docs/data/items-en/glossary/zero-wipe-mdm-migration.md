## Definition

Introduced in iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe, Zero-Wipe MDM Migration is a feature that allows a device to be moved from one MDM server to another without erasing the user's data. This process synchronizes through Apple School Manager (ASM) and allows the device to keep its existing applications and files while simply switching its "Manager." This eliminates the need for time-consuming backups and restores during a system upgrade or vendor switch.

## Plain English

In the past, switching to a new management system was like "tearing down a house and rebuilding it" just to change who was the landlord. Now, Zero-Wipe Migration is like "Keeping your house and all your furniture exactly as it is, but just hiring a new security company." All your photos, apps, and homework stay on the iPad, but the school gets to manage it using a newer, better system.

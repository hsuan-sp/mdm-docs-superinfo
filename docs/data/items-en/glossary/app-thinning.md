## Definition

App Thinning is an Apple optimization technology consisting of three pillars: Slicing, Bitcode, and On-Demand Resources. When a device downloads an app from the App Store, the system only downloads the specific assets (e.g., graphics for that specific screen size) required for that device. This significantly reduces download times and saves precious storage space on student iPads.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Custom Tailoring" for apps. Instead of delivering every possible version of an app (for iPad, iPhone, and Mac) to your device, the App Store only sends the parts that actually fit your specific hardware. It's like buying a shirt in your size rather than taking home a box containing every size from XS to XL.

## Definition

Apple Intelligence is the personal intelligence system introduced in 2025 (OS version 26). It uses on-device large language models (LLMs) to power features like Writing Tools, Mail Summaries, Genmoji, and Image Playground. To prioritize privacy, most processing happens locally on the device. It requires devices with M-series chips or A17 Pro chips and later.

## Plain English

Think of it as a "Private Assistant" living inside your iPad. It can help you rewrite an essay, summarize a long email, or even create a custom emoji, all while keeping your data strictly on your device so no one else can see it.

## MDM Context

Organizations can choose to fully enable or disable Apple Intelligence via MDM. In education, it is highly recommended to establish strong usage policies—especially during exams, where "Writing Tools" should be disabled to prevent academic dishonesty.

## Hardware Support

Apple Intelligence is not supported on entry-level iPads (9th/10th Gen). It requires an iPad Pro (M1 or later) or iPad Air (M1 or later).

## Definition

A transparency feature introduced in macOS Tahoe. App privacy permissions managed via MDM (such as Screen Recording or Full Disk Access) are now explicitly displayed in **System Settings > Privacy & Security**. These permissions are clearly labeled as "Managed by Organization," allowing users to see exactly what has been authorized by IT.

## Plain English

In the past, permissions granted by IT were "invisible." Now, they are listed on a "Public Authorization List." Users can easily see which apps have been granted special permissions by the school's management system, improving trust and transparency.

## MDM Context

While this increases transparency, it may also lead to user questions about why certain apps have high-level permissions. IT should be prepared to provide documentation explaining these security authorizations.

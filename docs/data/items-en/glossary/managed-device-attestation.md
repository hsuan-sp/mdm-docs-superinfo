## Definition

Managed Device Attestation is a high-level Apple security feature that uses the device's built-in **Secure Enclave** to provide cryptographically strong proof of its identity and integrity. It allows a device to prove to a server, "I am an authentic Apple iPad with specific hardware features, not a hacker's emulated or virtualized device." This provides a much higher level of security than simply checking a serial number or certificate.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Digital Biometric Verification" for the device itself. In the past, the system just asked for an "ID Card" (the serial number). Now, the system asks for a "Fingerprint or Iris Scan" of the machine's actual hardware. It proves the device is a real, physical iPad following the rules, and not an impostor or a fake computer program pretending to be a school device.

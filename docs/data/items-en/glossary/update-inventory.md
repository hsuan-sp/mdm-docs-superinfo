## Definition

Update Inventory is a standard MDM command sent to a device, requesting it to immediately report its current status to the server. This includes hardware specifications, lists of installed apps, battery health, available storage space, and current security settings. IT administrators frequently use this command as a first step in troubleshooting to ensure they are looking at the most recent data from the device.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Digital Roll Call." Just like a teacher needs to count the students and check if everyone has their textbooks ready before starting a lesson, the tech office sends this command to count all your apps and check your iPad's health. It ensures the school's records are 100% accurate and up-to-date.

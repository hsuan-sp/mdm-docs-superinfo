## Definition

AirDrop is Apple’s proprietary peer-to-peer wireless file-sharing service. It uses Bluetooth to discover nearby devices and creates a high-speed Wi-Fi Direct connection to transfer files. While convenient for collaboration, it can be a security risk. In a school setting, MDM can be used to restrict AirDrop to "Managed Contacts Only" or disable it entirely to prevent unauthorized file transfers.

## Plain English

This is "Wireless Hand-to-Hand" file transfer. You don't need a cable or a USB drive; if two devices are close enough, you can "throw" a file from one to the other instantly. It’s perfect for sharing a project with a classmate, but if not managed, it could lead to students accidentally sharing distracting or private files with people nearby.

## Definition

AirDrop for Business (Managed AirDrop) is a management capability that allows IT administrators to control how data is shared via AirDrop. By distinguishing between "Managed" and "Unmanaged" storage spaces, IT can prevent users from sharing sensitive school documents with personal devices while still allowing AirDrop for legitimate schoolwork between managed devices.

## Plain English

Think of this as an "Information Filter" for AirDrop. The school can set a rule that says, "You can AirDrop files between school iPads, but you are blocked from sending school work to your personal phone." This ensures that homework and sensitive data stay within the school's safe environment.

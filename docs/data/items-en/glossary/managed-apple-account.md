## Definition

A Managed Apple Account (formerly known as Managed Apple ID) is a professional Apple identity owned and managed by the school or organization. Unlike personal accounts, Managed Apple Accounts are created in bulk through **Apple School Manager (ASM)**. While they provide access to core iCloud services like Drive and Notes, they have specific restrictions: users cannot make private purchases, and the school’s IT department has the authority to reset passwords and audit data for safety and compliance.

## Plain English

Think of this as your "Official School ID" for the digital world. Just like your school email address belongs to the school, this account belongs to the school too. It’s for school work, storing your class files, and using school apps. Because the school owns it, they can help you if you forget your password, but you shouldn't use it for your personal TikTok or for buying personal games.

## Definition

TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network. They ensure that data transmitted between a client (such as a web browser or an iPad) and a server is encrypted and cannot be eavesdropped upon or tampered with by unauthorized parties. All secure communication between an MDM server and its managed devices relies on TLS encryption.

## Plain English

Think of this as the internet’s "Encrypted Mailbox." When you put a letter (your data) inside, the mailbox automatically locks it with a secret code. This ensures that while the mail carrier (the network) is moving the letter from one place to another, no one can peek inside or change what you wrote.

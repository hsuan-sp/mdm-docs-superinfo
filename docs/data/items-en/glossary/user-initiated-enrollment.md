## Definition

User-Initiated Enrollment (UIE) is a management onboarding process where a user manually triggers the enrollment of their device by visiting a specific URL or scanning a QR code. Unlike **Automated Device Enrollment (ADE)**, UIE does not provide a full "Supervised" status on its own, and the user has the ability to remove the MDM profile at any time. For this reason, it is generally not recommended for school-owned, one-to-one device programs.

## Plain English

This is a "Voluntary Enrollment Plan." Instead of the school "drafting" the iPad into service automatically (the ADE method), the student or teacher chooses to go to a website and sign up for school management themselves. However, because it's voluntary, the user can also choose to "quit" the plan at any time, meaning the school’s security rules will stop working.

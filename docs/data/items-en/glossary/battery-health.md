## Definition

Battery Health indicates the current maximum capacity of a device’s battery relative to when it was brand new (as a percentage). MDM can remotely collect this telemetry data, allowing IT administrators to proactively identify devices with aging batteries (e.g., those below 80% health) and schedule repairs before they lead to unexpected shutdowns or physical swelling.

## Plain English

This is the "Physical Exam Report" for a battery. A new battery has 100% capacity, but it "loses its stamina" over time as it is used. IT doesn't need to manually check every iPad; they can just look at a report to see which students have "tired" batteries that need to be replaced soon, preventing downtime in the middle of a lesson.

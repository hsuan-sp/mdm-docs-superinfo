## Definition

A new capability introduced in macOS Tahoe. If a Mac has "Remote Login" enabled and is connected to the network, an administrator can remotely unlock a FileVault-encrypted disk via an SSH connection. This allows for remote maintenance and troubleshooting without requiring physical presence at the Mac’s keyboard.

## Plain English

In the past, unlocking an encrypted Mac was like "Having to be there in person to turn the combination lock on a safe." Now, with SSH unlocking, it's like a "Verified Remote Unlock." As long as the computer is online, IT can securely unlock the "vault" from their office to fix a problem, saving them from having to walk across campus to your desk.

## Definition

Continuity is an umbrella term for Apple’s cross-device integration features, including Handoff, AirDrop, Sidecar, and Universal Control. It allows an iPhone, iPad, and Mac signed in to the same Apple ID to work together seamlessly. For example, a user can copy text on their iPhone and paste it on their Mac, or begin an email on one device and finish it on another.

## Plain English

This is "Mind Reading" for your Apple devices. It makes all your gadgets act like one big team. If you copy a photo on your iPhone, you can immediately "paste" it into a document on your Mac. It feels like there’s an invisible thread connecting all your devices so you can switch between them without losing your place.

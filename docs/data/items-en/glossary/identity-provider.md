## Definition

An Identity Provider (IdP) is a cloud service (such as Google Workspace or Microsoft Entra ID) that manages and authenticates user identities for an organization. Instead of the MDM system managing passwords itself, it "asks" the IdP to verify if a user is who they say they are. This enables Single Sign-On (SSO), allowing students and staff to use the same school email and password to log in to all their various school systems.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Global School ID Office." Instead of every individual website or app needing to keep its own list of students and passwords, they all just call the ID Office and ask, "Is this actually John Smith?" Once the ID Office confirms it's him, he is granted access. This means students only have one password to remember for everything.

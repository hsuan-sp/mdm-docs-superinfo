## Definition

Device Name is the "friendly" identifier displayed in the MDM management console and within the device’s own settings. IT can remotely set these names (e.g., "Account-JohnDoe-iPad") to quickly identify specific hardware among hundreds of units. This name is also visible to others on the local network via AirDrop and Bonjour discovery lists.

## Plain English

This is the device's "Digital Name Tag." Just as every employee might have their name embroidered on their uniform, IT can remotely "label" every iPad with the student's name and class. If someone finds a lost iPad in the hallway, they can see the name on the screen and know exactly who to return it to.

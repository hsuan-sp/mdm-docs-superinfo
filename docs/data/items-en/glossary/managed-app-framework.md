## Definition

Announced at WWDC 2025, the Managed App Framework is a modern architecture for delivering and managing app settings. It replaces the older "Managed App Configuration" method. This framework allows MDM to securely transmit configurations, security certificates, and passwords to apps through a dedicated encrypted channel. Unlike the old method, apps can now dynamically request settings updates while they are running, providing greater flexibility and security.

## Plain English

In the past, giving a new app its settings was like "leaving a note in a mailbox"—the app could only read it when it first opened. The new Managed App Framework is more like "Instant Messaging." The app can talk to the school system while you are using it to get the latest security updates and settings instantly. It’s faster, safer, and means your apps are always set up perfectly.

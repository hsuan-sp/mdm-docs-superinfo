## Definition

Unified Logging is a comprehensive system-wide logging mechanism used by all Apple platforms. It provides a centralized stream of logs from the operating system kernel and all applications. In the event of a system crash or network failure, IT administrators can use the `log collect` command to export these records. Analyzing these logs is the most accurate way to determine the exact timestamp and cause of a technical failure.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Black Box Flight Recorder" for your iPad or Mac. It silently keeps a detailed diary of everything the computer is doing—from connecting to Wi-Fi to opening an app. If the "plane" (your device) has a problem or crashes, the "Investigators" (the tech team) look at the black box diary to see exactly what happened in the seconds before the trouble started.

## Definition

Apple Intelligence Management refers to the MDM controls introduced in iOS 18+ and macOS 15+ to manage generative AI capabilities. Organizations can restrict whether AI tools can analyze user content (such as emails or documents) or transmission of data to **Private Cloud Compute (PCC)**. This ensures that sensitive institutional data is not inadvertently processed or learned by AI models, maintaining strict data privacy compliance.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Privacy Shield for AI." While Apple Intelligence provides powerful new tools to help with writing and organization, the school can choose to turn off certain features to make sure your school work and private messages aren't being "read" or "learned" by the AI. it keeps the school’s most sensitive secrets safe from being analyzed by a computer program.

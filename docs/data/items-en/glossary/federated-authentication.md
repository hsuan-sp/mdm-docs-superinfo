## Definition

Federated Authentication is an identity integration mechanism that links Apple Business Manager (ABM) or Apple School Manager (ASM) with an organization’s existing Identity Provider (IdP), such as Google Workspace or Microsoft Entra ID. Once configured, students and staff can log in to their "Managed Apple Accounts" using their existing school email and password, eliminating the need to manage multiple sets of credentials.

## Plain English

Think of this as "One Key for Every Door." Just as many websites allow you to "Log in with Google," Federated Authentication lets you log in to your school iPad using your regular school email password. You don't have to remember a separate "Apple password" just for school work, making it much easier to stay organized.

## Definition

A Proxy server acts as an intermediary between a local device and the internet. Instead of connecting directly to a website, the device sends its request to the Proxy, which then retrieves the data on the user’s behalf. Schools use Proxies to accelerate web loading (through caching) and to filter out harmful or inappropriate content, ensuring that all browsing remains within the school's "Digital Citizenship" guidelines.

## Plain English

Think of a Proxy as a "Personal Shopper" for the internet. Instead of you going directly to a store (a website) yourself, you give a list of what you want to your personal shopper (the Proxy). They go and get the data for you. This allows the shopper to check that the website is safe and doesn't contain any "forbidden items" before they bring the information back to your screen.

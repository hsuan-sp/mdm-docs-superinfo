## Definition

A Local Account is a user profile that exists solely on an individual computer's hard drive. Its username, password, and permissions are stored locally and are not synchronized with any cloud or network directory. While most school users use "Network Accounts" that follow them from device to device, Local Accounts are typically reserved for IT maintenance or for devices that do not require internet connectivity.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Room-Specific Key." This key (the account) only opens one specific door (one computer). If you try to use it on any other computer in the building, it won't work. It’s different from a school "ID Card" (Network Account) which can be used to scan into any classroom or library computer.

## Definition

Introduced in iOS 26.3, Background Security Improvements allow Apple to rapidly patch critical security vulnerabilities in system components like Safari and WebKit without requiring a full OS update or a device restart. This mechanism ensures that devices are protected against zero-day exploits as soon as a fix is available.

## Plain English

Previously, fixing a security bug was like "Shutting down the whole building for construction" (a full system update). Now, "Background Security Improvements" are like "Replacing a single broken lightbulb" while the building stays open. It’s fast, automatic, and doesn't interrupt your work.

## MDM Context

School IT admins should be aware that these updates happen automatically in the background. This improves overall security for the fleet and reduces the burden of manual patch management.

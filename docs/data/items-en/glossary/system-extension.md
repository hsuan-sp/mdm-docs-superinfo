## Definition

A System Extension is a modern macOS mechanism for expanding system functionality, such as adding advanced network filters or security monitors. It replaces older technologies like **Kernel Extensions (Kexts)**. System Extensions run in "User Space" rather than the system kernel, meaning that if a system extension crashes, it does not cause the entire Mac to crash or experience a "Kernel Panic," significantly improving overall system stability and security.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Keyhole Surgery" for a computer. In the past, to add a new security feature (like an antivirus), you had to perform "open-heart surgery" on the computer's most vital part (the Kernel), which was very risky. System Extensions are a safer, modern way to add those same features without touching its "heart." It makes the Mac more stable and much harder for hackers to break.

## Definition

A Wi-Fi Payload is a specific configuration block within a management profile. It contains all the necessary settings for a device to connect to a school network—including the Network Name (SSID), password, encryption type (like WPA3), and any required security certificates. By pushing this payload via MDM, IT ensures that devices automatically connect to the secure school Wi-Fi the moment they arrive on campus.

## Plain English

Think of this as an "Automatic Login Sheet." Instead of a teacher having to shout the Wi-Fi password across the room 30 times, IT "whispers" the password directly into the iPad's memory through the MDM. The iPad "reads" the password and connects to the internet automatically, so you're ready to start working the moment you walk into the building.

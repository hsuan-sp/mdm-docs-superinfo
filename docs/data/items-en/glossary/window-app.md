## Definition

Introduced as a core feature of iPadOS 26, Window App is an advanced multitasking system that allows iPad users to open and interact with multiple applications in resizable, overlapping windows, similar to the macOS desktop experience. Users can create specialized workspaces by dragging app icons to create "Split Views" or "Slide Over" windows. This represents a significant shift from the iPad's traditional full-screen app focus toward a hybrid productivity model.

## Plain English

In the past, using apps on an iPad was like "reading one book at a time" on your lap. With "Window App" in the latest system, using your iPad feels more like sitting at a "Professional Desk." You can have your textbook open, your notepad next to it, and a calculator floating on top, all at once. You can resize them and move them around just like you do on a laptop, which makes doing homework much faster.

## Definition

Firmware is the low-level software programmed into a hardware chip that controls the device's basic operations and initialization (such as iBoot on a Mac). It sits between the physical hardware and the operating system (macOS). Apple typically bundles firmware updates with standard OS updates to patch low-level security vulnerabilities and ensure hardware stability.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Built-in Brain" of the hardware parts. While the operating system is the software people use, firmware is the software the computer itself uses to function. It tells the screen how to light up and the fans how to spin. If this deep-level software is broken, the computer won't even be able to show a startup logo.

## Definition

Client Isolation (also known as AP Isolation or Wireless Isolation) is a security setting on a wireless access point (AP) that prevents connected devices from communicating directly with each other on the same Wi-Fi network. While this helps prevent the spread of malware within a network, it will also immediately disable peer-to-peer Apple services like AirPlay, AirDrop, and classroom management features that rely on local device discovery.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Anti-Social Mode" for Wi-Fi. Every device is put into its own soundproof room. They can all see the internet, but they can't "shout" to see who else is nearby. While this is very safe, it means students can't use AirPlay to project their screen or AirDrop files to their group members because the devices aren't allowed to talk to each other.

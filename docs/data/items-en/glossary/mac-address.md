## Definition

A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. It is conceptually an "Unchangeable" hardware ID. To protect user privacy, modern Apple devices use a **Private Wi-Fi Address** (MAC Randomization) to present a "Fake" MAC address to a Wi-Fi network, preventing the device from being tracked by its real hardware ID.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Fingerprint" of your device's Wi-Fi card. Technically, every device has a unique fingerprint. However, to stop strangers from tracking your movements as you move between different Wi-Fi spots, your device now "Wears Gloves" (Private Wi-Fi Address) so the networks see a different, random fingerprint that can't be traced back to you.

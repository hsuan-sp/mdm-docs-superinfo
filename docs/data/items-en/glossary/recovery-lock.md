## Definition

Recovery Lock is a critical security feature for Apple Silicon (M-series) Macs. It prevents unauthorized users from accessing **Recovery Mode** (by long-pressing the power button) to wipe the computer or lower its security settings. To enter Recovery Mode, a user must enter a specific password defined by the IT department via MDM.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Digital Lock on the ER Door." In the past, anyone could take a computer that wasn't working to the "Emergency Room" (Recovery Mode) and reset everything. Now, the ER door has a secret code. Without that code, a thief can't even "reinstall" the computer to erase their tracks, making the stolen Mac useless.

## Definition

A Temporary Session (also known as Guest Mode) is a feature of **Shared iPad**. It allows a user to tap "Guest" on the login screen and use the iPad without an Apple account. As soon as the user logs out, all data from that session—including browsing history, downloaded files, and app data—is permanently erased, ensuring the next user starts with a completely clean and private device.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Public Library Computer." You don't need a name or password to sit down and start using it. However, the moment you stand up and "log out," the computer instantly "cleans its own desk" and throws away any notes you left behind. This ensures the next person can't see what you were doing and the iPad stays fresh and fast.

## Definition

A feature of **Declarative Device Management (DDM)** introduced in macOS Tahoe. It allows MDM administrators to automatically bypass specific introduction screens in the **Setup Assistant**, such as the "OS Showcase" (which highlights new features) or the "Update Completed" notification. This streamlines the deployment process, particularly in high-volume environments like school computer labs.

## Plain English

In the past, every time a Mac was updated or set up, you had to "watch a short commercial" about the new features before you could start working. With Setup Pane Skipping, the school can tell the Mac to "Skip the Introduction." This saves time and allows students to get straight to their work without having to click "Next" on five different introduction screens.

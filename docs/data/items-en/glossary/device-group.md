## Definition

A Device Group is a container in MDM used to categorize and manage hardware. Groups are divided into "Static Groups," where administrators manually select devices to join, and "Smart Groups," which automatically filter devices based on specific criteria (such as iOS version, department, or serial number). Groups are the primary target for deploying management policies and configuration profiles.

## Plain English

Think of this as the school's "Classroom System." A Static Group is like a fixed class list where everyone stays in the same room. A Smart Group is like a "Level-Based Class"—students automatically move in or out based on their current achievement (e.g., if an iPad's battery drops below 20%, it automatically joins a "Low Battery" smart group for monitoring).

## Definition

Passkeys are a modern, "passwordless" authentication standard developed by Apple and the FIDO Alliance. They replace traditional passwords with unique digital keys stored on your device that are unlocked using biometrics (Face ID or Touch ID). Because they are based on public-key cryptography and do not require the user to "know" or type a secret, they are virtually immune to phishing attacks and password theft.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Replacing your password with your face or fingerprint." Instead of having to remember a complicated code like "P@ssw0rd123," your device creates a secret "Digital Key" just for you. When you want to log in, you just look at the camera or touch the sensor. It’s faster, impossible to forget, and a hacker can't "guess" it or steal it from you.

## Definition

"Install Application" is the primary MDM command used to instruct a device to install a specific app. The MDM server sends a list containing the app’s unique identifier (such as an App Store ID or Bundle ID) to the device. The device then schedules the download and installation from the App Store or the school's private server as soon as it is connected to a reliable network.

## Plain English

This is a "Digital Shopping List" for the device. Instead of the teacher having to manually download an app on every iPad, the teacher creates a list (the command) and sends it out. Every iPad in the class receives the list and immediately goes to the "store" (the App Store) to pick up the tools it needs for the lesson.

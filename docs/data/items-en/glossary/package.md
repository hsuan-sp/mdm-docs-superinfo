## Definition

A Package (.pkg) is a standard installer file format for macOS. It can contain application files, installation scripts, and metadata that defines where files should be placed and what permissions they should have. MDM systems can push these packages to Macs and install them silently in the background, allowing complex software to be deployed to hundreds of computers without requiring user interaction.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Digital Home Delivery Box." It doesn't just contain the item (the software); it also includes an "instruction manual" for the computer on where to put every part and how to set it up. When the school’s maintenance system sends this box to a Mac, the Mac reads the manual and puts everything in the right place automatically while the student is working.

## Definition

The "Intel Mac End-of-Support Milestone" marks the transition where Apple’s modern operating systems no longer support older Macs using Intel processors. **macOS Tahoe (v26)** is the final version of macOS to support Intel-based machines (such as the 2020 iMac and 2019 Mac Pro). This marks a critical deadline for schools to complete their transition to **Apple Silicon** (M-series) hardware to continue receiving the latest security updates and management features.

## Plain English

Think of this as the "Final Stop for the Old Train." macOS Tahoe is the last version of the system that will work on older Macs with Intel chips. After this, any "New Trains" (future macOS versions) will only run on the newer tracks (Apple Silicon chips). For school budgeting, this means any Intel Macs still in classrooms should be replaced soon so they don't become outdated and insecure.

## MDM Context

School IT administrators should audit their fleets in 2026 to identify any remaining Intel Macs. A phased replacement plan should be established:

* **2026**: Conduct inventory and budget for replacements.
* **2027**: Begin replacing high-use machines in computer labs.
* **2028**: Finalize the complete move to Apple Silicon to ensure fleet-wide security.

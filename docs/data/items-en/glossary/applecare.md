## Definition

AppleCare+ is an extended warranty and insurance plan for Apple hardware. In addition to extending the standard warranty period, it covers hardware repairs for "accidental damage" (such as a cracked screen or liquid spill) for a small deductible. For international schools like TES, purchasing AppleCare+ for a device fleet is a vital strategy for predictable budgeting and maintaining the long-term health of student-facing hardware.

## Plain English

Think of this as "Original Equipment Insurance." While everything comes with a basic 1-year guarantee, AppleCare+ goes further. If an iPad is accidentally dropped in the hallway and the screen shatters, the school doesn't have to buy a whole new device. Instead, they pay a very small "Processing Fee" and Apple fixes the screen or replaces the iPad with a fresh one.

## Definition

Ethernet is the standard for wired network connections (typically using an RJ45 cable). While modern iPads and Macs primarily use Wi-Fi, using a wired Ethernet connection during large-scale deployments or OS updates provides significantly faster transmission speeds and more stable communication with Apple’s servers (APNs), making it the recommended method for initial setup in an IT lab.

## Plain English

Think of Ethernet as a "High-Speed Private Train Track." Wi-Fi is like driving on a busy highway—it's convenient, but it can get congested or lose signal. Ethernet is a direct, solid connection that is much faster and more reliable, ensuring that when the school is updating 100 iPads at once, the internet doesn't "stutter" or drop out.

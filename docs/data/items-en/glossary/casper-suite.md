## Definition

The Casper Suite was the original brand name for what is now known as Jamf Pro (used from 2002 to 2015). While the name has been phased out, you may still encounter references to "Casper" in legacy documentation or older forum posts. In modern contexts, it invariably refers to Jamf Pro.

## Plain English

This is simply an "Old Brand Name." Just as a company might change its name to stay modern, "Casper" was the original name of the tools we now call "Jamf Pro." If you see a manual mentioning Casper, don't be confused; it's talking about the same management system you use today.

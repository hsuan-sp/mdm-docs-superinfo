## Definition

A security enhancement introduced in OS version 26. Blob URLs (temporary, browser-generated links to data) now respect "Managed Open-In" restrictions. This prevents users from bypassing organization-level Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies by using browser-based "Blob" links to export sensitive files from managed apps to unmanaged personal apps.

## Plain English

Previously, there was a "Hidden Secret Passage" (Blob URLs) that allowed users to move files out of the school's secured area and bypass the "No Exporting" rules. Now, the security guard (Managed Open-In) also monitors these secret passages, ensuring that school data remains strictly inside the approved school applications.

## Definition

TestFlight is Apple’s official platform for beta testing applications. Developers can use it to distribute pre-release versions of their apps to internal testers or up to 10,000 external users before officially launching on the App Store. Testers install the TestFlight app to receive updates and provide feedback directly to the developers. Each beta version is typically available for 90 days.

## Plain English

Think of this as a "Sneak Peek Movie Screening." Before a movie (an app) comes out in theaters (the App Store), the filmmakers might show a "work-in-progress" version to a small group of fans to get their advice on how to make it better. TestFlight is the "private theater" where students and teachers can try out new educational tools and help find bugs before they are released to the whole world.

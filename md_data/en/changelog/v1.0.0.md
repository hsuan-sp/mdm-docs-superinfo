### Initial Release (v1.0.0)

We are thrilled to announce the official launch of the **Superinfo Apple MDM Knowledge Base**. Designed specifically for education and enterprise environments in Taiwan, this modern knowledge hub aims to address the most complex challenges in Apple device management.

This release sets our standard for "Next-Generation Technical Documentation": extreme performance, seamless bilingual switching, and an elegant reading experience.

#### 🚀 Major Updates

**New "Liquid Glass" Design Language**

Introducing a visual system based on the 2026 Apple Design Guidelines, delivering an immersive experience like never before.

- **Dynamic Materials**: Featuring translucent white glass in Light Mode and deep smoked glass in Dark Mode, perfectly balancing aesthetics and utility.
- **Smart Contrast**: A typography system optimized for long-form reading, supporting system-level dark mode switching to reduce visual fatigue.
- **Fluid Motion**: Micro-interactions are implemented throughout the site, providing subtle physical feedback for every click and scroll.

**Bilingual Switching Engine**

Breaking down language barriers, we have rebuilt the multilingual architecture from the ground up.

- **Zero-Latency Switching**: Switch between English and Traditional Chinese instantly while reading any article. Handled by our proprietary content routing algorithm, no page reload is required.
- **Precise Terminology**: Includes over 220 Apple MDM-specific terms, proofread by Apple Certified Trainers to ensure professional consistency.

#### 🛠 Core Functionality

**1. Smart Search System**

- Supports fuzzy search, instantly finding accurate articles even with incomplete keywords.
- Search results provide context previews and are automatically sorted by relevance weight.

**2. Context-Aware Support**

- Integrated into the footer, this smart reporting system automatically detects and captures the user's current URL, browser version, and device information.
- This allows the support team to reproduce issues faster, significantly reducing ticket resolution time.

**3. Automated Quality Assurance**

- Built-in Markdown syntax checker ensures consistent formatting across all documents.
- Automated Link Checker regularly scans internal and external links to prevent "dead links" from affecting the reading experience.
